These are the codes I used for sainfoin RNAseq data collection at the University of Saskatchewan

For deseq2 analysis after obtaining countmatrix from rsem
a text file should be created with description
id is the genotype ID, condition is genotypes with their biological replicates gets same condition like A, B, C, type is paired-end

id	condition	type
genotype1.1	A	PE
genotype1.2	A	PE
genotype2.1	B	PE
genotype2.2	B	PE
genotype3.1	C	PE
genotype3.2	C	PE
